# Enhanced BMAD Workflow with Regression Prevention & Living Tests

## Overview

This document defines the complete enhanced BMAD workflow that integrates regression prevention and living test capabilities through a systematic manual handoff process between QA and Dev agents.

## 🎯 Workflow Objectives

**Solves the Core Problem:**
- ✅ Prevents the cycle: Implement features → Break old features → Spend time fixing them
- ✅ Captures manual fixes to evolve test coverage automatically
- ✅ Maintains systematic BMAD story-driven development

---

## 📋 Complete Enhanced Workflow

### **Phase 1: Pre-Implementation (QA Lead)**

#### **1.1 Enhanced Risk Assessment**
```bash
*risk-profile {story-id}
```
**QA Deliverables:**
- Risk assessment matrix with regression risk category
- Baseline verification requirements
- **Specific commands for Dev agent execution**
- Living test context setup (if regression risks identified)
- High-risk files for real-time validation

#### **1.2 Enhanced Test Design**
```bash
*test-design {story-id}
```
**QA Deliverables:**
- Test scenarios with regression prevention focus
- Given-When-Then requirements traceability
- Fix monitoring plan for living test system

#### **1.3 QA-to-Dev Handoff**
QA provides Dev agent with formatted handoff message including:
- **Mandatory command execution order**
- **Specific files to validate**
- **Living test context** (if needed)
- **Success criteria** for each phase

---

### **Phase 2: Implementation (Simplified Manual Process)**

#### **2.1 Pre-Implementation Setup (User Executes)**
```bash
# Step 1: MANDATORY baseline verification
npm run verify:baseline

# Step 2: IF QA identified regression risks, start living test capture
npm run living-tests start --context "{story-id}-regression-monitoring"
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Baseline verification passes (build succeeds, no critical issues)
- ✅ Living test capture started (if regression risks identified)

**If Baseline Fails:**
- ❌ **STOP** - Fix identified issues before proceeding
- ♻️ Re-run baseline verification until it passes

#### **2.2 Story Implementation (Dev Agent)**
```bash
# User command - Dev agent implements normally
/dev implement story {story-id}
```

**Dev Agent Process:**
1. **Implements story requirements** following normal BMAD workflow
2. **No interruption for validation** - focused implementation
3. **Documents files modified** during implementation
4. **Reports completion** when done

**Success Criteria:** ✅ All story acceptance criteria implemented

#### **2.3 Post-Implementation Cleanup (User Executes)**
```bash
# Step 3: MANDATORY cleanup after implementation
npm run living-tests stop
```

**Success Criteria:** ✅ Living test session stopped, capture data saved

#### **2.4 Completion Communication**
User confirms to QA that implementation is complete with:
- **Pre-implementation commands executed:** ✅ Baseline + Living test setup
- **Implementation completed:** Dev agent finished story
- **Post-implementation cleanup:** ✅ Living test capture stopped
- **Files modified:** List from dev agent implementation

---

### **Phase 3: Post-Implementation (QA Lead with Dev Results)**

#### **3.1 Enhanced Comprehensive Review**
```bash
*review {story-id}
```
**QA Analysis includes:**
- **Living test capture analysis:** Quality of auto-generated tests
- **Regression validation:** Pre vs post-implementation baseline
- **Fix pattern analysis:** Recurring issues suggesting architectural debt
- **Traditional review factors:** Code quality, requirements, NFRs

#### **3.2 Enhanced Quality Gate Decision**
```bash
*gate {story-id}
```
**Gate Decision Factors (in priority order):**
1. **Living test & regression factors** (baseline health, fix quality)
2. **Traditional quality factors** (requirements, security, performance)

**Gate Outcomes:**
- **PASS:** All criteria met, including healthy baseline
- **CONCERNS:** Issues present but can proceed with monitoring
- **FAIL:** Critical issues require resolution before proceeding
- **WAIVED:** Issues acknowledged and explicitly accepted

## 🔄 Manual Handoff Communication Protocol

### **QA-to-User Handoff Format:**
```markdown
## 🔄 QA-User Handoff: Story {story-id}

### 📊 Risk Assessment Complete
- **Risk Level:** HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW
- **Regression Risks:** [Yes/No] - Living test capture recommended
- **Baseline Health:** HEALTHY/DEGRADED/CRITICAL

### 🛠️ Pre-Implementation Commands (Execute Before Dev Implementation):

**Step 1: Baseline Verification (MANDATORY)**
```bash
npm run verify:baseline
```
✅ **Must Pass:** Build succeeds, no critical system health issues

**Step 2: Living Test Setup (If Regression Risks Identified)**
```bash
npm run living-tests start --context "{story-id}-regression-monitoring"
```
✅ **Success:** Living test session started successfully

### 🎯 Implementation Ready
Once pre-implementation commands succeed:
```bash
/dev implement story {story-id}
```

### 🧹 Post-Implementation Cleanup (Execute After Dev Completion):
```bash
npm run living-tests stop
```

### 📋 Handoff Checklist:
- [ ] Baseline verification passes
- [ ] Living test capture started (if regression risks)
- [ ] Dev agent implementation completed
- [ ] Living test capture stopped
- [ ] Ready for QA review

No real-time validation required - dev agent implements normally!
```

### **User-to-QA Completion Format:**
```markdown
## ✅ Implementation Complete: Story {story-id}

### 🔄 Commands Executed:
- [x] `npm run verify:baseline` - ✅ PASSED
- [x] `npm run living-tests start` - ✅ STARTED (if applicable)
- [x] `/dev implement story {story-id}` - ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] `npm run living-tests stop` - ✅ COMPLETED (if applicable)

### 🛠️ Implementation Summary:
- **Dev Agent Status:** Implementation completed successfully
- **Files Modified:** [List from dev agent output]
- **Story Acceptance Criteria:** All requirements implemented

### 📊 Living Test Results (if applicable):
- **Session ID:** {story-id}-regression-monitoring  
- **Capture Duration:** [Start time to end time]
- **Manual Fixes Detected:** [Number captured during implementation]

### ⚠️ Issues Encountered:
- **Baseline Issues:** [Any issues during baseline verification]
- **Implementation Issues:** [Any issues reported by dev agent]
