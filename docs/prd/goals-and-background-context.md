# Goals and Background Context

**Project Brief Status:** ✅ Yes - "Disaster Management PWA Project Brief.md" has been reviewed and incorporated

## Primary Goal

Create a Progressive Web App for disaster management in Borno State, Nigeria, implementing a structured Assessment → Coordination → Response workflow with offline-first capability to operate reliably in challenging field conditions with limited connectivity.

## Background Context

Current disaster response in Borno State lacks a coordinated digital system, resulting in:

* Assessment data loss during handoffs between field teams and coordinators
* Inability to track response activities end-to-end from planning through delivery
* No reliable offline-capable system for field operations in remote areas
* Limited transparency and accountability in donor-response tracking
* Inefficient paper-based processes causing delays in critical response times

## Success Vision

* **Zero Data Loss:** Robust workflow from form submission to backend with complete data integrity during Assessment → Coordination → Response handoffs
* **Comprehensive Tracking:** Reliable incident monitoring from Active through Resolved status with role-based flexibility and multi-role support
* **Operational Transparency:** Dashboards providing real-time visibility into disaster situations, response activities, and donor commitments/deliveries
* **Field Efficiency:** Seamless offline operation enabling continuous work regardless of connectivity status

## Business Rationale

This PWA addresses critical humanitarian coordination challenges in a region with extreme connectivity limitations. The offline-first architecture ensures continuous operation during disasters when infrastructure is compromised, while the structured workflow with flexible approval mechanisms maintains accountability through clear verification status indicators. The system's role flexibility and automatic approval capabilities prevent bottlenecks during high-intensity disaster response periods.
