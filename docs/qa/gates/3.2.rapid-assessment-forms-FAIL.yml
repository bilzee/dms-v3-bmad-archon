# Implementation notes
implementation_notes: |
  The dev agent claimed comprehensive implementation but this was inaccurate.
  
  What exists:
  - Database schema with all 6 assessment type models
  - Form components for all assessment types
  - TypeScript interfaces and validation schemas
  - Service layer business logic
  
  What's missing/broken:
  - UI pages to access the functionality
  - Working API endpoints (compilation errors)
  - User navigation and workflow
  - Authentication integration
  
  This represents a case where backend code exists but is completely
  inaccessible to end users, making the story effectively unimplemented.
