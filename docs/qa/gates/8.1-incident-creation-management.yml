  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Role-based authentication properly implemented with NextAuth.js middleware. Zod validation prevents injection attacks. API endpoints secured.'
  performance:
    status: PASS  
    notes: 'TanStack Query caching optimizes data fetching. Population impact calculations use efficient database aggregation. 30-second refresh intervals appropriate.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Proper error handling in API routes. Form validation provides user feedback. Service layer abstracts database operations.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Clean component architecture following established patterns. TypeScript provides type safety. Code follows project conventions.'
